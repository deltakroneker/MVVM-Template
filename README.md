# MVVM-Template

My approach in building iOS apps with MVVM-C architecture and RxSwift framework.

## Project navigation style:

- AppDelegate.swift

- Coordinators/
  - **MainCoordinator.swift**
  - ...
- UI/
  - Home/
    + **Home.storyboard**
    + **HomeViewController.swift**
    + **HomeViewModel.swift**
  - ...
- Networking/
  - Services/
    - **Authentication.swift**
    - ...
  - Response models/
    - **User.swift**
    - ...
- Protocols/
- Helpers/
- Resources/
  - **Assets.xcassets**
  - **LaunchScreen.storyboard**
  - **Info.plist**
  - ...
